The register was specifically made for Assam state.[1]\u00a0The register was first prepared after the\u00a01951 Census of India\u00a0and since then it has not been updated until recently.[2][3][4]\n\nThe North-East Indian state of\u00a0Assam\u00a0has become the first state in India where the updating of the NRC is being taken up to include the names of those persons whose names appeared in the NRC of 1951 and is still alive; and\/or of their presently living descendants who have permanent residence within the state.\n\nHowever, due to an amendment carried out in the Indian Citizenship Act, 1955, the State Register of Citizens for the state of Assam, which forms a part of the National Register of Citizens, has also been held to be legal to contain the names of all persons, whose names appeared at least in any of the\u00a0Electoral\u00a0Rolls published for any of the then assembly constituencies within the territorial limits of present-day state of Assam up to midnight of 24 March 1971 and also of descendants of such persons presently having permanent residence within the state. A person residing in the present state of Assam is also eligible to get his or her name entered in the register, if he or she holds and submit to the registering authority any of certain specific documents issued up to midnight of 24 March 1971 against his or her name or in the names of his or her ancestor which would prove the holder's or ancestor's presence within the territorial limits of the present day state of Assam. This is a peculiar situation in which any person, who has entered into the territorial limits of the present day state of Assam up to the midnight of 24 March 1971 from the neighboring country Bangladesh, or any of the person's descendant, can claim to be an\u00a0Indian citizen of the state of Assam throughout India\u00a0by dint of presence of his or her own self or of ancestor's, within the territorial limits of the present day state of Assam only but no other Indian states for that matter. In case of descendants, they further have to hold and submit to the registering authority another specific piece of document proving his or her blood relationship with a person whose name did appear in NRC, 1951 or in any of the said\u00a0Electoral\u00a0Rolls or whose presence in the territorial limits of the present day state of Assam is ascertainable with prescribed specific documents\n\n"}
